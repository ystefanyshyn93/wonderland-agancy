                <h3>EVENT PLANNING, EVENT DESIGN & WEDDING PLANNING…WE CREATE THE MOST MEMORABLE GUEST EXPERIENCES</h3>
                <p>Sasha Souza Events is considered one of the top event design & wedding coordination companies in the US. 
            We are also the most award-winning wedding design and event planning company in Napa and Sonoma and the only 
            twice published wedding design company in the San Francisco Bay Area. 
            We have offices in Napa, Sonoma, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. 
            We handle all types of events including weddings, corporate events, conferences, and fundraisers. 
            We have successfully designed events ranging from intimate weddings to galas for 3,000 guests.</p>

                <h3>The Sasha Souza Events Experience</h3>
                <p>The Sasha Souza Events guest experience encompasses many different adjectives: fun, energetic, moving, classic, romantic, intimate, thoughtful, and colorful. 
            Our vendors would tell you that as event planners, we are incredibly detail-oriented, hard-working, honest and reliable and we are the best event planners that 
            they work with because our events are bar-none. Our clients would tell you that their wedding or event reflected 100% who they are and their style.  
            This is because, from the beginning of the event design process, we want to know who you are. What you desire. What speaks to your brand and personality, 
            because our events are designed only with you in mind. That's why we start with a lengthy event design questionnaire so we can find out who you are and design
            the event around what means most to you.</p>

                <h3>Your Event Design Team</h3>
                <p>Hiring Sasha Souza Events to design your event includes hiring the best possible team to implement your overall vision.  
            Our event planning team consists of Sasha, Mellysa, and Lacey.  Together, we manage all the weddings, corporate events, fundraisers, day-of wedding planning,
            partial service wedding planning and full-service event design.  We're not a huge company, in fact, one of the best things about us is that we're small. 
            We don't farm you out to another planner, we are the planners you hire.  Along with us is our long-time floral designer, Leah.  
            If you love the events you see here, you'll love what she designs for you.  She's the most creative and talented floral designer you'll have ever met.  
            We also refer you to the best caterers, musicians, cake baker, photographers, video filmmakers and every possible service you will need to plan your event.</p>
